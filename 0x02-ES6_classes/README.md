# 0x02. ES6 Classes

## Introduction
Welcome to the ES6 Classes project! In this project, I will dive deep into the world of ES6 classes, learning how to define classes, add methods, use static methods, extend classes, and explore metaprogramming and symbols. This project is designed to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using ES6 classes in JavaScript, which is a fundamental aspect of modern JavaScript development.

## Resources
To successfully complete this project, I have referred to the following resources:
- [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- [Metaprogramming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Meta_programming)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I will be able to:
- Define a class in JavaScript
- Add methods to a class
- Understand why and how to add a static method to a class
- Extend a class from another class
- Grasp the concepts of metaprogramming and symbols

## Requirements
- All my files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors include vi, vim, emacs, and Visual Studio Code.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- My code should use the `js` extension.
- My code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`.
- My code will be verified against lint using ESLint.
- My code needs to pass all the tests and lint. I can verify the entire project by running `npm run full-test`.

## What I Will Learn
### How to Define a Class
In JavaScript, classes are defined using the `class` keyword. A class can include a constructor method for creating and initializing objects and other methods for defining the behavior of those objects.

### How to Add Methods to a Class
Methods can be added to a class directly within the class body. These methods will be shared by all instances of the class. Adding methods to a class allows for encapsulation of functionality, making the code more modular and reusable.

### Why and How to Add a Static Method to a Class
Static methods are defined on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class. They are used for functionality that is related to the class but not tied to any particular instance. Static methods can be called directly on the class without creating an instance.

### How to Extend a Class from Another
Extending a class allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This is done using the `extends` keyword. Inheritance promotes code reuse and can help in creating a clear and logical class hierarchy.

### Metaprogramming and Symbols
Metaprogramming involves writing code that can manipulate other code at runtime. Symbols are a new primitive type introduced in ES6 that can be used to create unique identifiers for object properties. Symbols can be particularly useful in metaprogramming, enabling more advanced and flexible code patterns.

## Conclusion
This project is an exciting opportunity to deepen my understanding of ES6 classes and enhance my JavaScript skills. By the end of this project, I will be well-equipped to leverage the power of ES6 classes in my future projects, writing more efficient, maintainable, and scalable code.

I am looking forward to diving into the exercises and solidifying my knowledge of ES6 classes.
