# 0x00. ES6 Basics

Welcome to my project on ES6 Basics! This project focuses on understanding the core concepts and features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015. Through this project, I'll be diving deep into the advancements in JavaScript that ES6 brings to the table, enhancing the way we write and understand JavaScript code.

## Concepts

For this project, I will explore the following concepts:

- JavaScript programming
- Software Linter

## Resources

Here are some resources I've used to learn and understand ES6:

- [ECMAScript 6 - ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)
- [Statements and declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Statements)
- [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
- [Default parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)
- [Rest parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [JavaScript ES6 â€” Iterables and Iterators](https://medium.com/@pravse/javascript-es6-iterables-and-iterators-63cfa1d5fb1f)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to be able to explain the following concepts confidently:

- What ES6 is
- New features introduced in ES6
- The difference between a constant and a variable
- Block-scoped variables
- Arrow functions and function parameters default to them
- Rest and spread function parameters
- String templating in ES6
- Object creation and their properties in ES6
- Iterators and for-of loops

## Requirements

To ensure the project meets the expected standards, here are some general requirements I will adhere to:

- All my files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- My code will use the `.js` extension
- My code will be tested using the Jest Testing Framework
- My code will be analyzed using the linter ESLint along with specific rules provided
- All of my functions must be exported

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help me grasp the foundational elements of ES6. The new features in ES6, such as block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template literals, and enhanced object properties, represent a significant shift from previous versions of JavaScript. These features not only make the code more readable and concise but also introduce powerful new ways to handle functions, parameters, and iterations.

### Key Features

1. **Block-Scoped Variables:** Understanding `let` and `const` and their scoping rules.
2. **Arrow Functions:** Exploring the concise syntax and the lexical scoping of `this`.
3. **Default Parameters:** Simplifying function definitions by providing default values.
4. **Rest and Spread Operators:** Efficiently handling function parameters and array elements.
5. **Template Literals:** Using backticks for multi-line strings and embedding expressions.
6. **Enhanced Object Properties:** Streamlining object definitions with shorthand syntax.
7. **Iterators and for-of Loops:** Iterating over iterable objects like arrays and strings.

### Development Tools

To ensure high-quality code, I will use the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code:** My preferred code editor for its powerful features and extensions.
- **Jest:** A robust testing framework to write and run tests.
- **ESLint:** A linter tool to analyze and improve my code quality by adhering to best practices.

By completing this project, I aim to build a solid foundation in ES6 that will enhance my JavaScript programming skills and prepare me for more advanced topics in modern JavaScript development.
